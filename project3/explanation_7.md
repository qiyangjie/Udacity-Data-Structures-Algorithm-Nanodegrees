class RouteTrieNode
insert method
Use defaultdict it is a hash mapping and can initialize itself
, which is time efficient in search.

- Time complexity is O(1)
- Space complexity is O(1)

class RouteTrie
insert method
Go through the char in the string one by one
n is the number of split sections.
- Time complexity is O(n)
- Space complexity is O(1)

find method
Go through the char in the string one by one
n is the number of split sections.
- Time complexity is O (n)
- Space complexity is O(1)
