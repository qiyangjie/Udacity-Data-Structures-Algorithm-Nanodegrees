The key to solve this problem is sort method. Two most common
sorted methods, quick sort and merge sort, were considered, I
use quick sort as it shows better space complexity.

- First quick sort
- Time complexity is O(nlog(n))
- Space complexity is O(1)

- Then go through the sorted list and assign to numbers
- Time complexity is O(n)
- Space complexity is O(1)

- Overall
- Time complexity is O(log(n))
- Space complexity is O(1)
